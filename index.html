                  2015 had the world’s worst refugee crisis since WWII. There was a huge influx of refugees into Europe and they will soon be ready to move out of camps into houses. EuroFugees helps connect those refugees in need to local europeans who are looking to rent out or help those refugees and welcome them into their homes. </h4>
                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  This was a project for my interaction design class and at the end of the course, we presented our projects to a crowd of 400 people. Out of 80 teams in the class, our team won an award for Best Social Impact. </h4>

                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  Each member on the team focused on a different part of building and designing the app. Working remotely with Syrian Refugees in Germany we conducted research with them, and then l moved to interaction design, visual design, prototyping, usability testing, iteration, and then production. </h4>

                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  We interviewed Syrian Refugees in Europe. Many had mentioned the extensive and expensive process to finding housing. With security and cost being a main issue. Refugees would have to pay a trusted middleman to help refugees find housing. These middlemen spoke the native language and made the process smoother, though it was pricey, costing upwards of a month's rent. </h4>

                  The main idea was to display important information about each listing on a card with a photo of the property. Important information included rent cost, location, and number of bedrooms/bathrooms. This goal was to only show the relevant and important information to the user first, as users judge quickly based on a few factors. I started with some rough sketches on paper, and then moved on to high fidelity prototypes. </h4>

                  Users generally enjoyed using the product, though a main concern with the app was with the initial search experience was too limiting and asked too many questions. The feedback we recieved from users was that they wanted to get a general idea of the housing market first, see what was available, then focus their search on what they specifically wanted from a property through a refine feature. </h4>

                  iKnowMed Generation 2 is the leading oncology EHR (electronic health record) software. During my time at McKesson Specialty heatlh, I worked with product designers and product managers on a redesign of the main Dashboard and My Tasks section of the application.   </h4>

                   Initially, the project was to redesign just the dashboard, but given how close they are to each other, and the overlap in widgets, a redesign of the dashboard also had to include a redesign of the my tasks section as well. Through this process I learned alot about this feature of the app, and after lots of feedback, time/logistical constraints, the final design turned out to be much different than the original prototype.  </h4>

                  


                  <h6 style="text-align:left"><b>PROBLEM</b></h6>
                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  The primary users of iKnowMed G2 are oncology specialisits, which tend to be older than others doctors due to the length of education needed to practice oncology. In additon to this, computer displays in practices tend to be dated, and on the smaller side. Screen real estate is a concern as the widgets do not scale properly, and as a result, information is not displayed correctly, including commonly used information. These factors together make the Dashboard and My Tasks unpleasant to use.   </h4>

                  I learned how different office roles use the dashboard uniquely, how people opportunistically use the dashboard, and the most commonly used widgets to drive the redesign of the Dashboard and My Tasks section. As the app is used across the entire practice, the main specialist uses the dashboard much differently than a receptionist or nurse. Even different practices would use the app differently and would use both Dashboard & My Tasks together in unique ways.  </h4>

                  The initial design categorized widgets by nature of use, into three sections: My Tasks, Dashboard, and Toolbox. The information dispayed is the most used information for that speciifc widget. The purpose of this design is to show the user the exactly relevant information at a glance. The function of the My Tasks section was to display actionable tasks that need to get done. This includes the To-Do List, Unfinished Charting, and Unscheduled Orders. Next to each entry in the widgets in an action button that lets the user accomplish the task associated with the entry.

                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  The function of the Dashboard is to display consumable information relvant to the user's patients. This includes the Alerts, Patient List, and Visit List widgets. Similarly with My Tasks, there is an info button that enables the user to find out more information regarding a specific entry. The buttons are associated with the intended use of the section. Action button for actionable tasks to complete, info button for consuming facts, figures, and other patient information,

                 <h6 style="text-align:left"><b>Toolbox</b></h6>
                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  The function of the Toolbox Section is to display generatable information such as looking up patients, and viewing/printing audits and reports. This section consolidates all the audit and reports widgets into one widget.

                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                    After receiving feedback and going back and forth with other product designers and managers, I learned that this design did not enable the user customize their page  to their liking, and although the widgets displayed less information, there were still 3 columns and it cluttered and hard to find information.

              <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  The new design considerations for the next iteration were:

                <ul>
                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  <li>Decreasing the amount of widgets displayed at once (2 columns) to better use screen space and free mental clutter.</li>
                  <li>Like before, displaying abbreviated versions of the widgets to make the information easier to glance over. </li>
                  <li>Enabling the user to customize their Dashboard by categorizing the widgets by nature of use.</li>
                  <li>Introduced tabs to go through related widgets more quickly and to make more efficient use of screen space.</li>

                </ul>

                  <h6 style="text-align:left"><b>FINAL PROTOTYPE FOR USER TESTING</b></h6>
                  <h4 style="text-align:left">
                  Feedback from users said that tabs would not be used too much, as they can easily access the widgets from the library on the right. This design takes into account many considerations, and enables the user to customize the page to their liking. There are only two columns, resulting in a more minimal design as well. The vertical waffle button on the widgets enables the user to expand to the full view of the widget. This prototype was used for testing at the annual Physician Advisory Board meeting in Las Vegas.
